# DAILY_CODING
every day a new code challenge!!!

* **DAY1**: Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

* **DAY2**: Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i. 
For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

* **DAY3**: return a new sorted merged list from K sorted lists, each with size N.
For example, if we had [[10, 15, 30], [12, 15, 20], [17, 20, 32]], the result should be [10, 12, 15, 15, 17, 20, 20, 30, 32].
